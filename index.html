                My first Journey with God started when sir Joffrey teaches us
                about the bible. He teaches us everything we need to know about
                the bible.

                My second journey is that I was able to describe my relationship
                with God as my father, explore the stories of how God journeyed
                with His chosen people-the Israelites, and manifest actions of
                gratitude for God's enduring presence of sustaining a peaceful
                and just society as seen in the Israelite's experience and how
                it is constantly felt by Christians today. We also describe
                God’s presence and intervention in human life and affairs
                according to the Sacred Writings.

                We also learned about Mary and how good she is. We also describe
                our own Mother; her good qualities and the things that she have
                done to me. We also point out various elements needed when you
                prepare to welcome someone important in your life and identify
                Jesus in the events of my everyday encounters.

                At the end of my journey, I was able to explain the importance
                of prayer in my life and demonstrate a prayerful attitude
                centered on inclusivity, resiliency and active response towards
                the whole of creation.

            Through this course I have journey with God in different ways. Every
            class, we always start it with opening prayer and ends it with
            closing prayer. Through this, I have able to have a talk with God
            even though I'm not the one praying I still give my time to the
            prayer and listen to it with my heart. Through this course, it made
            me watch and have time to God by watching Livestreams on Facebook
            and sometimes going to the church in person. I learned many things
            about the word of God, his teachings to us and why God is the most
            poweful among all of us. Being a Journey with God makes me happy, I
            spend time in God's pressence and encounter him in the duties of my
            daily life.
